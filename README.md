# Cyriously In Japan

This project was created using ReactJS, SASS, and Firebase. 
I wanted to make something that combined my interest in development with my interest in Japan. ðŸŽŒ
One of my goals is to someday travel to Japan to see the sights, try the food, and experience the culture!

I've built a few different features into this app, you can:
- Keep a list of places you want to visit.
- Translate phrases to Japanese from English, or vice-versa.
- Practice your kana knowledge with a fun game.

You can check it out live, [HERE](https://cyriouslyinjapan.com/).
